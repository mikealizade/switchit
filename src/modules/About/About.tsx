            <S.Text>

              at scale by switching en masse to greener financial providers.

            <S.Text>
              Switch It Green Co-Founders, Anna Chirico and Sophie Cowen, first connected over their shared frustration at climate inaction
              in 2020. They knew that for just climate solutions to be heard, big corporations first had to be held responsible. They could
              see that individual actions needed to have clear direction, and be taken en masse to initiate real change. And they knew that
              in order to get key decision makers to listen, they had to follow the money.
            </S.Text>
            <S.Text>And with that, Switch It Green was born.</S.Text>
            <S.Text>
              Our mission is to pressure banks to change their investment policies to rapidly phase out fossil fuel financing, by harnessing
              the power of individual action to move Â£ billions out of fossil fuel support. Without support from customers, banks will be
              less able to invest in fossil fuels. Without investment from financial institutions, the fossil fuel industry will be under
              significant pressure to transform its operations. Your role is simple:

              impact of your switch.

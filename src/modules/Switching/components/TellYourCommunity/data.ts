      'Hi all,',
      `I wanted to share with you a green organisation who have been on my radar recently. The organisation is called Switch It Green (switchit.green) and they are a campaign and platform mobilising people to take impactful climate action at scale by switching to greener financial providers.`,
      `I hadn't realised that most UK banks are investing £ billions into polluting industries and that switching to greener financial providers is one of the most impactful things we can do for the planet.`,
      `I am in the process of switching to a green current account through their new platform and so far the process has been really easy and informative. They also have research coming soon on pensions and business banking.`,
      `Switch It Green are supporting thousands of people to switch over £7 billion worth of lifetime investments out of fossil fuel support in 2023. If everyone at <strong>[insert company]</strong> switched their current account to a green bank, we alone could move over £<strong>[number of employees x 1 million]</strong> out of fossil fuel support. Switching en masse will help pressure banks to improve their investment policies - plus, Switch It Green have a number of steps to help maximise each switch.`,
      `They also offer 'Employee Switching Programs' with resources and guest speakers covering a number of topics from financial literacy to broader environmental education, which I think would be really valuable to <strong>[insert company name]</strong>.`,
      `Have a great day!`,

      `I recently found out that most UK banks are investing £ billions in the fossil fuel industry. I just switched my current account to one which has no ties to fossil fuel companies through a new platform called Switch It Green and thought you might want to check it out. On average, each person switched means over £1.5 million of lifetime deposits are moved out of fossil fuel support.`,

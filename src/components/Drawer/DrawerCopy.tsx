        A {`bank's`} rating is decided based on a set of normative criteria established by ethicist
        and Researcher, Dr William Shakey. An overview of each rating is as follows:
      </p>
      <BulletList>
        <li>
          1 out of 5 - Among the biggest investors in fossil fuels. Current fossil fuel investments
          over £100 million.{' '}
        </li>
        <li>
          2 out of 5 - Current fossil fuel investments between £25 million and £100 million with a
          suitable divestment commitment and strategy; or, current fossil fuel investments below £25
          million with an insufficient divestment commitment and/or strategy.{' '}
        </li>
        <li>
          3 out of 5 - Current fossil fuel investments less than £25 million with a suitable
          divestment commitment and strategy.{' '}
        </li>
        <li>
          4 out of 5 - Does not invest in fossil fuels but has not committed to never investing in
          fossil fuels.
        </li>
        <li>
          5 out of 5 - Does not invest in fossil fuels and has a clear policy prohibiting future
          investment in fossil fuels. Also invests in positive environmental initiatives.{' '}
        </li>
      </BulletList>
      <p>
        We define {`'suitable'`} commitments as those whose goal is to completely phase out (not
        down) fossil fuel funding - including both projects and shares - with evidence of
        significant and measurable steps already being undertaken and with definitive accountability
        for all targets. A {`'suitable'`} divestment strategy is one which eliminates the
        possibility for future fossil fuel investments, with clear and measurable steps for phasing
        fossil fuel funding out of existing investment portfolios and shares. A timeline for
        divestment is deemed to be {`'suitable'`} only if there are planned divestment measures
        already in place, a clear and significant target set for 2025 at the latest, or a target for
        complete, water-tight divestment set for 2030 at the latest. We do not accept {`'Net Zero'`}{' '}
        commitments unless they include plans for complete divestment of all investments and shares
        by 2030, or are demonstrating significant progress with an acceptable 2025 target - no
        matter how many pictures of wind turbines they manage to cram into their swanky pdf.

        Unless you have 7+ figures in your bank account (in which case, may I introduce you to our
        donate button?), you are worth a lot more to your bank than your account balance. Banks use
        their customer base as leverage to secure loans and assets; often the same loans and assets
        that allow them to invest in fossil fuel projects and companies. {`Banks'`} customer numbers
        are frequently used as evidence that they are a secure product in whom the market can trust.
        The market is mostly indifferent to how much money an individual customer has in their
        account, what {`they're`} interested in is the customer themselves as an asset.

        So, how much are you worth, as a stable asset, to a bank? {`We've`} done the research and,
        if you pop in your age to our impact calculator, we can give you a solid estimate of how
        valuable you are to a bank.
